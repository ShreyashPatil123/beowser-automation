# Icons

To test the extension properly, you need 3 standard extension icons in PNG format:

- `icon16.png` (16x16) - Used for the favicon or small contextual menus
- `icon48.png` (48x48) - Used for the extensions page and top right bar
- `icon128.png` (128x128) - Used during installation and by the Chrome Web Store

You can use any image editor, or even place a transparent color block or a logo of a lightning bolt!

For now, the extension will run without them (it will complain in `chrome://extensions` with a warning, but it will work). If you want to rid of the warnings, just drop any three PNG images with those exact names here.
